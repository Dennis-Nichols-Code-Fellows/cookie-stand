      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Fishing for Chinook Salmon in the beautiful rivers of Washington State and the Pacific Northwest is a family
        tradition. One of the ways we've always escaped the business of the city has been to take a trip to the peaceful
        environs of the Nisqually River. However, the sad truth is that the river we grew up with is not the same one we
        are taking our children to. We started <span>The Salmon Cookie Store</span> to draw attention to the challenges
        facing our rivers and the beautiful creatures which call them home.
